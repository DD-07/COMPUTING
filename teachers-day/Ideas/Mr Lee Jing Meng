Dear Mr Lee,
  I have always found your experiments fun and interesting.
  Be it separating a mixture through chromatography
  Or putting a raw quill egg in water,
  it was always fun and I would like to ask
  Whem will our next one be at?
  
  You have given us so much notes
  About SE, PCM, ECM, SS and ST
  As well as PNM, AS, CE, MS and LT
  And I would like to ask
  How much more will we get?
